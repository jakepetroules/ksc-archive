Identification of variables:
    pair1 : PairOfDice - The first pair of dice
    roll : int - The value of the roll of pair1
    die3 : Die - The third die
    die4 : Die - The fourth die
    pair2 : PairOfDice - The second pair of dice

The program presents a user with a menu:
Enter a choice:
(1) Play dice
(0) Quit

The program prompts for a number

If the user enters 1:
    A PairOfDice called pair1 is instantiated
    The pair is rolled to randomize the values
    The sum of the values is displayed to the user

    A die, die3, is created with the maximum face value
    Another die, die4, is created with a random face value (1-6)

    A PairOfDice, pair2, is instantiated
    The faces of the internal die in pair2 are set to the faces of die3 and die4
    The pair2 is rolled and the sum of its internal face values are displayed to the user
Else if the user enters any other number:
    The program quits
