Prompt the user with a menu:
    Enter 1 to draw a line
    Enter 2 to draw a rectangle
    Enter 3 to draw a square
    Enter 4 to draw a triangle

If the user entered 1:
    Prompt the user for a length N
    Output N * characters
Else if the user entered 2:
    Prompt the user for a length L and a width W
    For each length L
        For each width W
            Output a *
        End for

        Output a new line
    End for
Else if the user entered 3:
    Prompt the user for a width D
    For each width D
        For each width D
            Output a *
        End for

        Output a new line
    End for
Else if the user entered 4:
    Prompt the user for a height H and a base B
    For each height H using iterator I
        Determine line width as B * ((I + 1) / H)
        Determine pad width as (B - line width) / 2

        For each pad width P
            Output a space
        End for

        For each line width L
            Output a *
        End for

        Output a new line
    End for
