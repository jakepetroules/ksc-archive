Projects are organized according to platform. As you can see, this root folder contains a folder for each mobile platform, which in turn contain the projects for those platforms.

The documentation for each application resides in that application's folder with the name jpetroules<PROJECT-NAME>. The documentation for Yaakov's Mine is an XHTML file and the rest are all in RTF.

My portfolio actually contains every application I developed in the course, including my midterm project (the Yaakov's Mine game for Windows Mobile).
