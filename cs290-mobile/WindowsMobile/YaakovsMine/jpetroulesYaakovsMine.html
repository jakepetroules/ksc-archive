<h1>Yaakov's Mine</h1>

<p><em>You are the Dwarven engineer Gad Yaakov. There is much metalworking to be done, and you must travel into the mines to obtain as much ore as you can. You also have a chance to test the explosive chemical nitroglycerin in your mining excursion so that you may document its use the engineering book you are writing. Good luck!</em></p>

<p>The objective of the game is to obtain as many points as possible. The player may obtain points by mining rocks which fall from above. The player must also avoid being hit by falling rocks.</p>

<p>The player may use their pickaxe or nitroglycerin to mine rocks. Harder rocks may need to be hit more times with a pickaxe before they are destroyed and added to the player's inventory. Similarly, higher level pickaxes will decrease the time needed to destroy a rock. Nitroglycerin will always destroy a rock in one hit.</p>

<p>Crates containing various objects may also fall from above. There are three types of crates: medical, nitroglycerin, and pickaxe. The medical crates will restore the player's hitpoints by a random amount between 50 and 200. The nitroglycerin crates will award the player additional vials of nitroglycerin with which to destroy rocks (1 vial per crate). The pickaxe crates will upgrade the player's pickaxe.</p>

<p>The player starts with 1000 hitpoints and a bronze pickaxe. If the player is hit by falling rocks, they will lose hitpoints according to the density of the rock (all rocks have relatively the same size or volume). If the player reaches 0 hitpoints, the player will die and their high score will be displayed.</p>
