The program issues a prompt for an integer value to find the number of odd, even and zero digits in, and then gets the integer value from the user. It goes through all the digits of the number, and uses math functions to determine if it is zero, even or odd, then increments the respective counters. The program then prints the number the user entered, and displays the number of each type of digit in it.
