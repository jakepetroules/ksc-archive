This program demonstrates the use of object oriented programming with sphere objects whose diameter can be changed and the volume and surface area calculated. The program prints that message to the user to explain what it does. The program creates a number formatter and sets the number of decimal digits to 4. The program then instantiates two Sphere objects, with their diameters set to 1 and 3, respectively. The program then prints the state of each sphere (its diameter, volume and surface area). The program then sets the first sphere's diameter to 5, and the second's to 10. The program then prints the second sphere's diameter, and then and prints the state of each sphere again.
