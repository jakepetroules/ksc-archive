This program demonstrates the use of object oriented programming with light bulb objects that can be turned on or off. The program prints that message to the user to explain what it does. The program then instantiates two Bulb objects, and turns the first bulb on. The program then prints the state of each bulb (whether it is on or off). The program then turns off the first bulb and turns on the second, and prints the state of each bulb again.
