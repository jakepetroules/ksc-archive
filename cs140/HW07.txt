This program will print the first few verses of the traveling song "One Hundred Bottles of Beer".

The program explains to the user what it does, and proceeds to ask them how many verses of the song they would like to be printed. The program then gets their input and checks to make sure the number they entered is in the range 1 to 100, continually asking them for proper input if their answer falls outside that range.

The program then loops through the verses, printing the following lines for each iteration:
	"<n> bottles of beer on the wall"
	"<n> bottles of beer"
	"If one of those bottles should happen to fall"

followed by "<n-1> bottles of beer on the wall" OR "No more bottles of beer on the wall" and "Go to the store and buy some more" if <n-1> is equal to 0.
