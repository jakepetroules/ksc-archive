The program prints a message "This program determines the value of coins in a jar." to explain to the user what it does.

The program creates a Scanner object to get input from the user.

The program then asks for the number of quarters and stores the result in an integer variable.
The program then asks for the number of dimes and stores the result in an integer variable.
The program then asks for the number of nickels and stores the result in an integer variable.
The program then asks for the number of pennies and stores the result in an integer variable.

The program computes the dollar value of the coins using the following formula:

(quarterCount * QUARTER_VALUE) + (dimeCount * DIME_VALUE) + (nickelCount * NICKEL_VALUE) + (pennyCount * PENNY_VALUE)

The program then displays the number of each type of coin the user entered, and displays the summed dollar value of all the coins.
