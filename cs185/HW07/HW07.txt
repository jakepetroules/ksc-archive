The program prints a message explaining what it does.

The program creates an polymorphic array of LibraryItems, containing two of each:
Novel, MyText, and Weekly. It then prints the contents of this array.

It then sorts the array using the selection sort algorithm, and prints a message
stating that it did so.

It then prints the contents of the array again, this time sorted.
