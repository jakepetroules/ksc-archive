The program prompts the user for their age and the number of years forward (positive number) or backward (negative number) in time they want to travel.

The program then goes through time, asking the user the color and condition of their house at each step.

When the user enters a number that will result in their age being outside the range 0 to 100, exclusive, the program prints (in reverse order) the user's age and house details at each step.
