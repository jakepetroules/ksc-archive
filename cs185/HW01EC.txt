The program instantiates a BufferedReader to read input from the user.

It then prints a message and prompts for input, reading the user's name and their birth date. If invalid values are entered for either field, the program continues to prompt them for valid input.

The program prints a message saying "The birthday month for {name} for the year {birth year} is:" and prints a monthly calendar for the user's birth year, formatted like so:

            September
  S    M    T    W    T    F    S
  1    2    3    4    5    6    7  
  8    9   10   11   12   13   14  
 15   16   17   18*  19   20   21  
 22   23   24   25   26   27   28  
 29   30  
 
 The above example shows what the calendar would look like for September 1991. The program will also put a * next to the day of that month on which the person was born.
 
 The program then prints "{name}'s current age is {age}", using the current date and time to calculate the user's age in years, and exits.
