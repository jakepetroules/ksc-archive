The program prints a message explaining what it does.

It then creates an IntegerPairCollection, which is derived from my previously
created generic collection class, demonstrating the principle of software reuse.
It reads the input values from the file values.inp and stores them in the collection.

The program then creates an instance of my previously created GridFormatter class,
used for neatly formatted output, again demonstrating the principle of software reuse.

The program loops through each pair of integers previously read from the values.inp file,
and calculates their products, quotients and division remainders. It catches any ArithmeticExceptions
that occur during the calculations of the quotients and division remainders, and displays
an error message instead of the integer result, for each operation that fails.

The program then uses the capabilities of the GridFormatter to write the contents of the calculation
table to a file, values.out, along with an information message explaining the contents of the file.
